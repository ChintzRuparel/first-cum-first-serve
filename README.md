<b>What is First Cum First Serve?</b>

First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve.

`Coded in C++`

<b>Characteristics of FCFS</b>
<ul>
  <li>It supports non-preemptive and pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.</li>
  <li>Jobs are always executed on a first-come, first-serve basis.</li>
  <li>It is easy to implement and use.</li>
  <li>This method is poor in performance, and <b>the general wait time is quite high. </b></li>
</ul>
